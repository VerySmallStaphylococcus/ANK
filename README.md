# ANK

A Nano Kernel

------

## Goal

The purpose is to be a cute little kernel

## Supporting things

There's not much yet 
First, 32 bits and 64 bits are supported

## How to use

First of all, few have been made yet, and there are only defined functions, so we will announce them later
Now, the sauce itself is small, so it would be okay to look directly into it.
I hope you take care of this part

## Tech Stack

I quite like pure and unspoiled C, so this project will only be managed with pure C and Makefile

## Other precautions

My main language is Korean, not English.
That's why I write a Rhythm or Kermit message. Sometimes I can write in Korean, not English, or I can use a translator, so I can say something a little awkward or weird. Please note that

And PR is always welcome. Please do your best

License... Well, I won't say much if you just use it. But there are not many features that the kernel itself supports, so there won't be much you can do even if you use it. Please judge this part on your own
But if you're curious about Jeong's license, please let me know
The license is CC0 1.0 Universal. If you're curious about anything else, go to the license tab and watch it
